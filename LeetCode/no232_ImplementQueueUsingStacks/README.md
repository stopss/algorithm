# No.232 Implement Queue using Stacks
https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/submissions/  
</br>

## 문제 설명
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).
* void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
* int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
* int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
* boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.  
</br>

## 제한 사항
* 1 <= x <= 9
* At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
* All the calls to pop and peek are valid.  
</br>
